//local backend is hte simplest - but this does not allow collaboration

//tfstate should be at a central backend
      // S3
      // consule
      // HTTP
      // ETCD

//tf user to tf backend authentication should be there
//tf file should be able to lock in the backend ( to avoid currptions by parallel users)
